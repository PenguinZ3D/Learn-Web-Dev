Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight I'm gonna show you off
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby, don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
Now slow it down for me baby (slow it down girl)
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind
Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby, don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
Fellas grab your ladies if your lady fine
Tell her she the one, she the one for life
Ladies grab your fellas and let's do this right
If you're on one like me and mine
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us, ay?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Girl, we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us, ay? (Feels so good)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (with you)
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us, ay?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us, ay?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it
